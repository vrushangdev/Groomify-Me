    <string name="preliminaries_heading1">What does prematurity among child means?</string>
    <string name="preliminaries_heading2">Symptoms</string>
    <string name="preliminaries_content1">A premature birth is a birth that takes place more than three weeks before the baby\'s estimated due date. In other words, a premature birth is one that occurs before the start of the 37th week of pregnancy.
Premature babies, especially those born very early, often have complicated medical problems. Typically, complications of prematurity vary. But the earlier your baby is born, the higher the risk of complications.
Depending on how early a baby is born, he or she may be:\n
\u2022	Late preterm, born between 34 and 36 completed weeks of pregnancy\n
•	Moderately preterm, born between 32 and 34 weeks of pregnancy\n
•	Very preterm, born at less than 32 weeks of pregnancy\n
•	Extremely preterm, born at or before 25 weeks of pregnancy\n</string>
    <string name="preliminaries_content2">• Small size, with a disproportionately large head\n
• Sharper looking, less rounded features than a full-term baby\'s features, due to a lack of fat stores\n
• Fine hair (lanugo) covering much of the body\n
• Low body temperature, especially immediately after birth in the delivery room, due to a lack of stored body fat\n
• Labored breathing or respiratory distress\n
• Lack of reflexes for sucking and swallowing, leading to feeding difficulties</string>
